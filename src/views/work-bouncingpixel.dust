    <p>As the lead developer at Bouncing Pixel's studio I was able to work on a wide array of awesome projects. A bit of everything, from a games to custom web apps.</p>
    <p>What I enjoyed most was working one on one with people to turn their ideas into working products. The whole process from the initial meetings to the final delivery was incredibly fulfilling to complete.</p>
    <p>Three of the projects I worked on were awarded a citation of excellence and two silver ADDY <a href="https://www.bouncingpixel.com/awards" target="_blank">awards</a> from the American Advertising Federation.</p>
