    <p>Developed a haiku Twitter contest micro-site with Node.js that includes a custom CMS for accepting tweets and selecting weekly winners. Built out designerâ€™s mockups and styled into a fully functional responsive layout.</p>
    <p>Implemented the Twitter API on the backend to cache recent tweets containing the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LetsTalkBums%20%23haiku" target="_blank">#LetsTalkBums</a> to a MongoDB database and to await admin approval before displaying them on the contest page.</p>
